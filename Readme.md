# Atticus

This is *very* rudimentary start to the Atticus coding assessment.

## Overview

General rundown of my approach:

- Built with Next.js / Typescript
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and styling
- [Tanstack table](https://tanstack.com/) for table implementation



## Callouts

- I went over on the time - total actual coding effort was ~ 3hrs.
- I did use some boilerplate of my own from previous projects as a starting point
- I do think that the time constraint is somewhat tight, given the feature asks
- In hindsight, I'd spend less time on the data side of things and more on the UI
- The attempt at 'normalizing' the schema was prob. unwise given the timeframe



Some other omissions for the sake of time:

- Typescript hardening 

- Would address component layout

- Better error handling 

- Tests, obviously
